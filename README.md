# Gin Admin Theme

## Introduction

Gin is a work in progress and may have dramatic changes before the first official release. Although it is a fork of Gin for Drupal, the end result may not necessarily be a one-to-one replica of all styles and functionality.

## Installation

 - Install and enable this theme using the official [Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/themes).

 ### Set Gin as default admin theme

 - Navigate to Admin > Appearance
 - On the same page, click "Enable" under Gin
 - At the bottom of the page, switch the Administration theme to Gin

 ## Issues

  - Bugs and Feature requests should be reported in the [Issue Queue](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/gin/issues).

## Troubleshooting and Local Development

- Setup Gin locally that you can compile CSS & JS files.\
`nvm use && npm i`

- Run dev env with watcher and debug output (development process)\
`npm run dev`

- Compile assets\
`npm run build`
