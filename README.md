# Tonic Admin Theme

## Introduction

Tonic is a work in progress and may have dramatic changes before the first official release. Although it is a fork of Gin, the end goal may not necessarily be a one-to-one replica of all styles and functionality.

## Installation

 - Install and enable this theme using the official [Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/themes).

 ### Set Tonic as default admin theme

 - Navigate to Admin > Appearance
 - On the same page, click "Enable" under Tonic
 - At the bottom of the page, switch the Administration theme to Tonic

 ## Issues

  - Bugs and Feature requests should be reported in the [Issue Queue](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/tonic/issues).

## Troubleshooting and Local Development

- Setup Tonic locally that you can compile CSS & JS files.\
`nvm use && npm i`

- Run dev env with watcher and debug output (development process)\
`npm run dev`

- Compile assets\
`npm run build`
